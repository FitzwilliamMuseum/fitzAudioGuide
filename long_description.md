### Help us transcribe the Fitzwilliam Museum's audioguide

Hello, I'm Daniel Pett and I lead the Fitzwilliam Museum's digital team. In these
uncertain times of Covid-19, we're all trying to make the most of the situation
and I need some help. Maybe you can be that person?

Our museum has a legacy auidoguide that I want to make work harder and augment
our collections information with searchable text of the descriptions and stories
that were created for the audio tour. These texts could help sensory deprived people
experience our amazing objects in a different way, and maybe we could translate them.

So for this application, I have split the tours into 10 second segments or when there is a
space in the audio. I'd like you to listen to the text and look at the automatically generated
transcription and correct it if needed.

If you can help me, then I'll post your name as a contributor to our internal
and external systems.

Thank you for your time, I and the MicroPasts team appreciate it.

Daniel
